## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* Data is stored **in-memory** and resets when the server restarts.
* Use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test endpoints.
* ‚úÖ Fix this minor issue in `main.go`:

  In your code, the delete handler is:

  ```go
  r.HandleFunc("movies/{id}", deleteMovie).Methods("DELETE")
  ```

  It should be:

  ```go
  r.HandleFunc("/movies/{id}", deleteMovie).Methods("DELETE")
  ```
